# One engine process of the `libsignal-cli` CLI: the extern hook contracts

**Trusted in part.** The headlines of `Computational/Theorems/Main.lean`
(`libsignal_cli_pq_secure_elf_binary_placed` and `libsignal_cli_pq_binary_correct_placed`, see
`Computational/docs/TRUSTED_BASE.md`), together with the symbolic binary headlines
`signal_session_secure_placed` (`Symbolic/Theorems/Security.lean`) and `comp_refines_cli_placed`
(`Symbolic/Theorems/Refinement.lean`), use `11` of the `22` definitions in this file via the
`27`-row relocatable hook table `cliHookTablePlaced` and `Placed.cliRunPlacedSig`
(`CliBinaryPq.lean`): `CliHooks`, `PathOk`, `ancestors`, `blockingAncestor?`,
`isUnmodelledPathComponent`, `pathComps`, `readPath`, `unitResult`, `unmodelled`, `writeFileHook`,
and `writeStdoutHook`. The remaining `11` definitions left the headline closure when their rows were
de-hooked (`cliDehookedSymsPlaced` in `CliBinaryPq.lean`) so the linked ELF code executes:
`readFileHook`, `readStdinHook`, `vecEmptyOk`, `vecErr`, and `vecOk` when F3 + IO.6b de-hooked
`lsReadFileSym` and `lsReadStdinSym` (`libsignal-cli-io`), and `strlenHook`, `memrchrHook`,
`fromUtf8Hook`, `Utf8Ok`, `durationSinceExactHook`, and `cliBcmpHook` when the second stock
`ld.lld` cutover (C2) de-hooked `strlen`, `memrchr`, `from_utf8`, `duration_since`, and `bcmp`.
They are kept here outside the headline cone for fixed-image/legacy proofs and read-loop
correspondence. A reader who trusts those theorems trusts, from here:

* `PathOk` (with `readPath`, `pathComps`, `isUnmodelledPathComponent`, `ancestors`,
  `blockingAncestor?`): the file paths the I/O specifications model (relative, canonical, no NUL,
  not a stdio name).
* `unitResult`, `unmodelled` (in the headline closure), and `vecErr`, `vecEmptyOk`, `vecOk`
  (outside the headline closure; kept for fixed-image/legacy read-hook proofs): hook return and
  result helpers.
* `writeFileHook`, `writeStdoutHook` (active in `cliHookTablePlaced` until `W-DIS0`), and
  `readFileHook`, `readStdinHook` (de-hooked under F3 in `cliDehookedSymsPlaced`, outside the
  headline closure, kept for fixed-image/legacy proofs): the contracts of the four I/O functions of
  `libsignal-cli-io`.
* `strlenHook`, `memrchrHook`, `fromUtf8Hook` (with `Utf8Ok`), `durationSinceExactHook`,
  `cliBcmpHook`: the other CLI-specific extern contracts (de-hooked at C2, outside the headline
  closure, kept for fixed-image/legacy proofs).
* `CliHooks`: what a run is quantified over: the abstract primitives.

## How hooks are found

`Step prog` fetches every instruction from memory, so `prog.code` plays no part in a run. Under a
multi-block placement `mpl` (`Placed.cliProgPlacedSig mpl mmpl W` in `CliBinaryPq.lean`), at `pc`,
`Program.externAt?` looks up whether `pc` is the placed address `mpl.ρ name` of a hooked extern or
panic symbol (`cliExternsPlacedSig mmpl W`); if so, the step is the hook (`Step.extern`), which may
change any state except frozen memory and the symbol table; otherwise the instruction in memory
runs. Unhooked zero-word stubs decode to `udf #0` and halt (fail closed), and `overrides` are `none`
so compiled code runs for every defined symbol.

## The I/O functions: compiled read paths and the write hook boundary

The CLI does all of its I/O in four `#[inline(never)]` functions of its own I/O crate,
`libsignal-cli-io` (`third_party/libsignal/libsignal-session/cli/io/`, Rust path
`libsignal_cli_io`). `libsignal-session/translation.toml` keeps `libsignal-cli-io` out of
`libsignalSessionMultiLib` (which has a symbol for each: `lsReadFileSym`, `lsWriteFileSym`,
`lsReadStdinSym`, `lsWriteStdoutSym` in `CliBinaryPq.lean`) and `cli/io/translation.toml` translates
it separately into `GeneratedLean.SignalSessionIoPlacedObj` (`signalSessionIoMultiLib`). At the F3 +
IO.6b re-link (`10` trusted hook removals across `M2-1b`: `B2-TLIT` `−2` `RawVec::grow_one` `49 → 47`,
and F3 `−8` rows `47 → 39`, `cliHookTablePlaced_length_guard`—`7` de-hooked in
`cliDehookedSymsPlaced` (`2` read, `5` `__rust_*` onto `VerifiedLibraries.mallocngLib`) plus
`<String as Clone>::clone` as an intra-library block under SC-1 route (I)), `read_file` and
`read_stdin` are de-hooked and execute the linked `libsignal-cli-io` ELF bytes (bounded C-ABI musl
`open`/`read`/`close`/`__errno_location` loops in `SignalSessionIoPlacedObj`, proved in
`LibsignalBinary/Proofs/SignalSession/CliIo/`); `readFileHook`, `readStdinHook`, `vecEmptyOk`,
`vecErr`, and `vecOk` remain in this file outside the headline closure for fixed-image/legacy proofs
(with retired fixed-image `cliHookTable`, `cliExterns`, `cliBase`, and the demangled I/O stub-name
constants proof-side in `LibsignalBinary/Proofs/SpecLemmas/SignalSession/CliRunFixed.lean`). On the
write side, `cli/io/src/lib.rs` implements `write_file` and `write_stdout` as 0-allocation C-ABI
musl `open`/`write`/`close`/`__errno_location` loops (`< 4096`-B NUL-free stack path check,
`O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC | O_CLOEXEC` mode `0o666`, `EINTR` retry, `n == 0` treated as `Err`,
and `EBADF` on `fd = 1` treated as `Ok(())` matching `std`'s `handle_ebadf` and `read_stdin`), which
remain zero stubs and disclosed trusted hooks (`writeFileHook`, `writeStdoutHook`) in
`cliHookTablePlaced` until `W-DIS0` proves their compiled blocks (DEV-CLI4, DEV-CLI8, DEV-CLI21,
DEV-CLI19). Paths are relative to the party's directory and looked up by their canonical form
(`FsState.files`), as `Process.lean` describes.

**Only `write_file` changes the files, and it says so in the trace.** Of all the hooks of
`cliExternsPlaced mmpl W` (`CliBinaryPq.lean`), only `writeFileHook` changes `fs.files`, and every
other active hook leaves `fs` alone (legacy `readStdinHook`, like compiled `read_stdin`, changes
only file descriptor 0's offset). `writeFileHook` also appends one
`TraceEvent.fileChanged path` event on every `PathOk` `< 4096`-byte path call that reaches `openat`
(written or not; paths with an interior NUL or `len ≥ 4096` return `Err` before `openat`), the event the
engine's `openat` appends when it creates or truncates a file, so a run segment whose trace has no
such event did not call `write_file` on a valid path and left `fs.files` as it was. The event is not output:
stdout keeps only `writeByte` events (`traceStreamBytes`), so it changes neither `outcomeOf` nor
the run's `Outcome`.

**DEV-CLI4 (machine model): I/O does not fail except as specified.** The I/O specifications
fail only where Linux / the bounded I/O crate fails on the engine's file system for these calls: a
path of `4096` bytes or more (`ENAMETOOLONG`) or containing an interior NUL byte, a path through a
regular file (`ENOTDIR`), a missing parent directory on write (`ENOENT`), a directory where a file is
expected (`EISDIR`), a regular file above `fileCapBytes` (`2^21`) on `read_file`, standard input
above `stdinCapBytes` (`2^20`) on `read_stdin`, and an out-of-memory allocation failure on a read
buffer (DEV-CLI15, DEV-CLI21; `vecOk` in the legacy hook model). On the linked compiled read paths
(`cli/io/src/lib.rs`, de-hooked in `cliDehookedSymsPlaced` at F3's `47 → 39` cutover,
`cliHookTablePlaced_length_guard`, and proved in `LibsignalBinary/Proofs/SignalSession/CliIo/`),
`read_stdin` and `read_file` enforce those same
`stdinCapBytes = 2^20`, `fileCapBytes = 2^21`, and `< 4096`-byte NUL-free stack-path bounds (mapping
`ENOENT` to `Ok([])` and `EBADF` on `fd 0` to `Ok(out)`), while `write_file` and `write_stdout` are
0-allocation C-ABI musl `open`/`write`/`close`/`__errno_location` loops (`< 4096`-byte NUL-free stack
path check, `O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC | O_CLOEXEC` mode `0o666`, `EINTR` retry, `n == 0` treated
as `Err`, `close` on every exit after `open`, and `EBADF` on closed `fd 1` treated as `Ok(())`
matching `std`'s `handle_ebadf` and `read_stdin`; in `processInputs` `fd 1` is open `.stdio` stdout)
and remain trusted disclosed hooks in `cliHookTablePlaced` until `W-DIS0` proves their compiled
blocks (DEV-CLI19). At the `write_file` / `write_stdout` hook boundary no file descriptors are
opened or closed and no write system calls are executed until `W-DIS0`. A real
kernel can also fail for other reasons (`EMFILE`, `ENOSPC`, `EIO`, a denied permission (`EACCES`; no
mode bits), a short write, a full disk
mid-commit); such a failure gives exit 2 in the real CLI, possibly after a partial commit. Effect:
the theorems say nothing about runs on which the kernel fails an I/O call in another way; the run
otherwise ends as the real one does (same exit code, stdout and files).

**DEV-CLI8 (machine model): the hooked I/O model omits real read `Vec`-growth allocations.**
Compiled `libsignal-cli-io` (`read_stdin`, `read_file`, executed directly in the binary theorems)
reads through `4096`-B stack buffers and grows output `Vec<u8>`s on a doubling schedule up to
`stdinCapBytes` / `fileCapBytes` (DEV-CLI21), whereas the legacy read hooks (`readFileHook`,
`readStdinHook`, outside the headline closure) allocate a single exact-size block via `vecOk` and
`write_file` / `write_stdout` perform zero heap allocations. Legacy hook-form theorems make no claim
when a doubling allocation fails where `vecOk`'s exact-size block fits.

**DEV-CLI19 (machine model): write I/O hooks in `cliHookTablePlaced` (`write_file`/`write_stdout` until `W-DIS0`; `read_file`/`read_stdin` de-hooked at F3).**
At the F3 + IO.6b re-link (`10` trusted hook removals across `M2-1b`: `B2-TLIT` `−2`
`RawVec::grow_one` `49 → 47`, and F3 `−8` rows `47 → 39`, `cliHookTablePlaced_length_guard`—`7`
de-hooked in `cliDehookedSymsPlaced` (`2` read, `5` `__rust_*`) plus `<String as Clone>::clone` as
an intra-library block under SC-1 route (I)), `read_file` and `read_stdin` left `cliHookTablePlaced`
and execute compiled `SignalSessionIoPlacedObj` blocks proved against musl
`open`/`read`/`close`/`__errno_location` in `LibsignalBinary/Proofs/SignalSession/CliIo/`, while the
`2` write functions `write_file` and `write_stdout` (`0`-allocation C-ABI musl
`open`/`write`/`close`/`__errno_location` loops in `SignalSessionIoPlacedObj`, with `0` GNU-`std` /
`core::io` undefineds and `0` allocator or panic relocations in `write_*`) remain zero stubs in the
ELF and disclosed trusted hooks (`writeFileHook`, `writeStdoutHook`, and budget-threaded
`WriteFileEnv` / `WriteStdoutEnv` in `LibsignalBinary/Heap/SpecBudget.lean` with `0`
`withVmPreserved`/`liftVm` wrappers at call sites) in `cliHookTablePlaced` until `W-DIS0` proves
their compiled blocks.

Paths outside the modelled set (`PathOk`: non-canonical, a NUL byte, a component that `fsView`
hides) and
caller buffers that are not readable / writable make the two write hooks fail closed
(`.Exception`); since the second stock `ld.lld` cutover (C2) they are the only CLI-specific rows of
`cliHookTablePlaced`. The shared hooks (the primitives) check no permissions.

## Free choices

`W : CliHooks` holds the abstract primitives (`C`, `Q`). Its two former free choices, `bcmp`'s
nonzero value (with C's contract `bcmp_ok`) and `from_utf8`'s `Err` payload (`utf8Err`), were
removed once the second stock `ld.lld` cutover (C2) de-hooked `bcmp` and `from_utf8` and no row read
them: the run executes the linked musl `bcmp` and the compiled `from_utf8`. (`cliBcmpHook` and
`fromUtf8Hook` above take these as explicit arguments, for fixed-image/legacy proofs.)

## Notable rows of `cliHookTablePlaced` (`CliBinaryPq.lean`)

* not hooked: `std::sys::random::linux::hashmap_random_keys` (the CLI builds no `HashMap`) and
  `libsignal_session_rng_fill` (the CLI's coins are plain Rust, `cli/src/coins.rs`); reaching
  either halts (fail closed by design);
* not hooked since the first stock `ld.lld` cutover: `memset` and `memcpy` (in
  `cliDehookedSymsPlaced`; the run executes the linked `VerifiedLibraries.mallocngLib` blocks
  `21` / `20`);
* not hooked since the second stock `ld.lld` cutover (C2): the musl routines
  `memmove`, `bcmp` (with the `memcmp` it tail-calls) and `strlen`, and the compiled Rust functions
  `memrchr`, `from_utf8`, `duration_since`,
  `<SystemTime as Add<Duration>>::add`, `subtle::black_box` and the
  x25519-dalek `StaticSecret` / `SharedSecret` destructors (all in `cliDehookedSymsPlaced`; the run
  executes their linked code). With `memmove` de-hooked no row is `hookMemmove` (an `abbrev` of
  `hookMemcpy`, `ProofLib/Hoare/LibcHooks.lean`), so neither `hookMemmove` nor `hookMemcpy` is
  trusted any more;
* CLI-specific: `write_file` / `write_stdout` (above; `read_file` and `read_stdin` are de-hooked in
  `cliDehookedSymsPlaced`).
* `core::fmt::write` (`Ok`, nothing written) and `format_inner`
  (an empty `String`). Their results reach no stdout byte, path or file of the CLI: the CLI's own
  code (`cli/src/`, the I/O crate) uses no `format!` / `write!` / `to_string` (it builds decimal
  numbers and address text by hand, `stores.rs`), so a `core::fmt` call can come only from library
  code whose text the CLI never prints or stores.

Names: sret = the result buffer whose address the caller passes in `x8`.

/-! ## Paths -/

/-- The path argument `(ptr, len)` of an I/O function as an `FsState.files` key: one character per
byte (`Char.ofNat`), as the engine reads a path of `openat` (`readCString`, `ISA/Eval.lean`). -/
def readPath (m : Memory) (ptr len : BitVec 64) : String :=
  String.ofList ((m.readBytes ptr len.toNat).map fun b => Char.ofNat b.toNat)

/-- The components of path `p`: its characters split at `/` (`List.splitOn`). On a `PathOk` path
they are the segments of the engine's canonical form (`Arm64.normalizePath`). -/
def pathComps (p : String) : List (List Char) := p.toList.splitOn '/'

/-- A component the specifications do not model: empty (a leading, trailing or doubled `/`, or the
empty path), `.` or `..`. -/
def isUnmodelledPathComponent (c : List Char) : Bool := c.isEmpty || c == ['.'] || c == ['.', '.']

/-- **The paths the I/O specifications model**: relative and canonical (every component non-empty
and neither `.` nor `..`), no NUL byte (Rust's `CString` would reject it), and no component that
`fsView` hides (`stdioPaths`, `Run.lean`), so every file a hook reads or writes is observable. The
standard streams themselves are not in the file system (`FsState.files`): the loader opens file
descriptors 0, 1, 2 as `.stdio` descriptors, and stdin's bytes are `FsState.stdin`.
On such paths the engine's canonical lookup (`FsState.files`) agrees with the way Linux resolves
them. -/
def PathOk (p : String) : Bool :=
  (pathComps p).all fun c =>
    !isUnmodelledPathComponent c && !c.contains '\x00' && !(stdioPaths.contains (String.ofList c))

/-- The proper ancestors of `p`, shallowest first: `"a/b/c"` gives `["a", "a/b"]`; a single
component has none (its parent is the party's directory, which exists). -/
def ancestors (p : String) : List String :=
  let cs := pathComps p
  (List.range (cs.length - 1)).map fun i => String.ofList (['/'].intercalate (cs.take (i + 1)))

/-- **The first proper ancestor of `p` that is not a directory**, with what is there: `some
(some (.file _))` (Linux: `ENOTDIR`) or `some none` (missing: `ENOENT`); `none` if every proper
ancestor is a directory. This is Linux's walk of the path's directories (`link_path_walk`). -/
def blockingAncestor? (fs : FsState) (p : String) : Option (Option FsEntry) :=
  ((ancestors p).find? fun q => match fs.files q with | some .dir => false | _ => true).map
    fs.files

/-! ## Results -/

/-- `Err(IoError)` of a `Result<Vec<u8>, IoError>` at sret `x8` (capacity niche
`0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF` at `[x8]`, then return; legacy read-hook helper). -/
def vecErr : State → State :=
  retHook fun s => s.setMem (s.mem.write64 (s.readReg64 .x8) 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF#64)

/-- `Ok(Vec::new())` at sret `x8` (`{cap = 0, ptr = 1, len = 0}` via `E2E.writeVecHeader`, then
return; legacy read-hook helper). -/
def vecEmptyOk : State → State :=
  retHook fun s => s.setMem (E2E.writeVecHeader s.mem (s.readReg64 .x8) 0#64 1#64 0#64)

/-- `Ok(bs)` at the sret (legacy read-hook model, outside the `Computational/Theorems/` headline
closure since F3 de-hooked `read_file` and `read_stdin` in `cliDehookedSymsPlaced`; kept for
fixed-image/legacy proofs): `vecEmptyOk` for empty `bs`; otherwise a lowest-fit heap block of
`bs.length` bytes (`E2E.bumpThen`, the allocator hooks' block), `bs` copied in, the header
`{len, block, len}`. If no block fits: `E2E.allocPanicHook` (log `allocFailedEvent`, then
`.Panicked`), as for every other failed allocation of the legacy hook-allocator CLI. Why: compiled
`libsignal_cli_io::{read_file, read_stdin}` (`cli/io/src/lib.rs`) grow their output `Vec<u8>` via
`Vec::reserve_exact` (`4096 * 2^j` up to `1 MiB` / `2 MiB`), which calls `handle_alloc_error`
(abort) on OOM rather than returning `Err`.
**Modelling choice: capacity = length.** Compiled `read_stdin` / `read_file` return a power-of-two
capacity `4096 * 2^j >= bs.length` (`CliIo.ReadLoopCommon.cliIoFinalCap`). The CLI
never grows these vectors, `__rust_dealloc` is a no-op hook in the legacy hook model (DEV-E6), and
nothing the CLI prints or writes depends on a capacity or a heap address, so the run's exit code,
stdout and files are the same. Hooks are functions of the state (`Program.externs`), so a range of
capacities would need one more free choice in `CliHooks`.
This argument is about runs in which every allocation succeeds: a larger real power-of-two capacity
within `stdinCapBytes` / `fileCapBytes` can fail where `vecOk`'s exact-size block fits (DEV-CLI8). -/

      E2E.allocPanicHook

/-- Return `Ok(())` (`x0 := 0`) or `Err(IoError)` (`x0 := 1`) of a `Result<(), IoError>`

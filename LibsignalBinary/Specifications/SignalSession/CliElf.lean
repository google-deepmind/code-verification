# The `libsignal-cli` ELF, built from source

**Trusted: the statement.** `cliElfBytes` is the raw byte sequence of
`.GeneratedLean/cli-elf/libsignal-cli.elf`, read at elaboration time via `file_bytes%`
(`Arm64/Trusted/Process.lean`), which verifies the SHA-256 digest pinned below.

**Where the file comes from.** It is not committed (`.GeneratedLean/` is gitignored).
`scripts/cli-elf-stock --stdbin --build` builds it from source with stock LLVM `ld.lld`
(`-static -no-pie --no-relax --gc-sections`, linker script
`third_party/libsignal/libsignal-session/cli-elf/stock/stock_c2.ld`, base `0x400000`), with the
`libsignal` revision, `rustc` `1.98.1` (and its `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` `self-contained/` CRT
objects and `libc.a`), `zig` (for `rdl_shim.S`), `ld.lld` version prefix, `std-main` entry crate,
and `arm64-semantics` commit pinned in
`third_party/libsignal/libsignal-session/cli-elf/stock/inputs_stock_stdbin.lock`, from the same
Rust objects that `rust-obj2lean` reads: the compiled crate objects and trimmed `alloc`/`std`
sysroot members of `libsignal-session/translation.toml` (`cliLinkObjs`, extracted into
`libsignalSessionLib` = `libsignalSessionMultiLib`), and the `libsignal-cli-io` crate object of
`cli/io/translation.toml` (`SignalSessionIoPlacedObj`). In CI, the parallel `cli-elf-build` job
builds the ELF from source, checks its SHA-256 and link metadata against the lock and this module's
pin (`scripts/cli-elf-stock --stdbin --verify-pin --lean-mod
LibsignalBinary/Specifications/SignalSession/CliElf.lean`), checks structural invariants and
separate-path-depth deterministic reproducibility (`scripts/cli-elf-stock --stdbin --verify` and
`--check`), and runs the A-LINK linker-resolution check (`scripts/stock-pin/alink_check.py --lock
third_party/libsignal/libsignal-session/cli-elf/stock/m4_stock.lock`); the `lake build` job then
downloads the verified ELF artifact, re-checks `--verify-pin`, and builds and audits the lake
library `CliElfLib` (which owns this module and lists `.GeneratedLean/cli-elf/libsignal-cli.elf` as
an `input_file`; no default lake root imports this module). These jobs and steps run unconditionally
on every `push` to `main` (and `workflow_dispatch`) and on `pull_request`s touching the ELF's byte
or build inputs, trusted specifications, or the `CliElfLib`-only proof modules
(`scripts/clielf_ci_paths.txt`); a PR that modifies only shared upstream proof modules skips them,
so any breakage it introduces in the `CliElfLib`-only modules surfaces on the first `main` push that
contains it, and the binary-level verification claim refers to a `main` commit SHA whose
`cli-elf-build` and `lake build` jobs ran the CLI ELF steps green.

**What the pin means.** Anyone can rebuild the ELF from source and compare its SHA-256 with the pin.
The pin is the only place where a byte of the ELF is named. Every address the statement uses comes
from the ELF itself (`ElfImage.parse`, `loadState`) or from `libsignalSessionLib` and
`VerifiedLibraries.mallocngLib` under kernel-checked `MultiPlacement`s `mpl` and `mmpl`
(`CliBinaryPq.lean`, stock `ld.lld` link under `stock/stock_c2.ld` at base `0x400000`; name labels:
`CliLabelsFromObjects` (`CliLabels.lean`)).

## Main definitions

* `cliElfBytes`: the raw bytes of the pinned `libsignal-cli` ELF, the subject of every binary-level
  CLI statement (`CliBinaryPq.lean`, `CliBinaryExtProofDefs.lean`).
